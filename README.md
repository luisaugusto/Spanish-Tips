# Spanish Tips

This script is run through a [manual workflow](https://github.com/luisaugusto/Spanish-Tips/actions/workflows/create_tip.yml), which I dispatch when I have something that I want to learn about in my Spanish Studies. The script calls OpenAI for information and then adds the response to Notion so I can refer to it later.

Running a Github workflow whenever I have a question seems a bit tedious, but I have setup an [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/282566d81a8641e7bb8de5ef374254e8) on my phone so that I can use Siri or dispatch the workflow from the control center.
