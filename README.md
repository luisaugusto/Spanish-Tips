# Notion AI Doc Generator

This project leverages OpenAI and Notion to generate and store useful content. It currently supports two main features:

## Spanish Tips

> [View Spanish Tips in Notion](https://www.notion.so/22028e1a435d807cb1a3fca3e2675d1f)

The Spanish Tips feature allows you to generate and store useful information about Spanish language studies in Notion. It uses OpenAI to provide detailed explanations and examples based on your queries.

### How It Works
1. The user provides a question or topic they want to learn about in Spanish.
2. OpenAI generates a detailed response, including:
   - Explanations of grammar rules.
   - Vocabulary lists.
   - Example sentences.
3. The response is uploaded to a Notion database for easy reference.

### Example Workflow
- Provide a prompt like: "Explain the difference between 'ser' and 'estar' with examples."
- The tool generates a detailed explanation and uploads it to Notion.

### iOS Shortcut
You can use an [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/282566d81a8641e7bb8de5ef374254e8) to quickly dispatch the workflow for generating Spanish tips. This allows you to use Siri or the control center to trigger the process.

## Recipe Generator

> [View recipes in Notion](https://www.notion.so/Recipe-Book-26428e1a435d80f1a06dc90d0a457626)

The recipe generator feature allows you to create detailed cooking recipes based on user prompts. It uses OpenAI to generate the recipe data and uploads it to Notion, complete with ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional information, and a high-quality image of the dish.

### How It Works
1. The user provides a prompt describing the recipe they want to create.
2. OpenAI generates a detailed recipe, including:
   - Ingredients and quantities.
   - Step-by-step preparation and cooking instructions.
   - Nutritional information.
3. A high-quality image of the dish is generated based on the recipe details.
4. The recipe is uploaded to a Notion database, including all the generated details and the image.

### Example Workflow
- Provide a prompt like: "A vegan lasagna recipe with a creamy cashew-based sauce."
- The tool generates the recipe and uploads it to Notion.

### iOS Shortcut
Similar to the Spanish Tips feature, you can use an [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/282566d81a8641e7bb8de5ef374254e8) to quickly dispatch the workflow for creating recipes. You can create a similar one for the recipe generator as well
